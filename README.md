# Connect Four with Pygame
The main goal of this project is to build a program that can play Connect Four against players. 

The logic of AI are as follow, ranked with the priority: 

1) search for and complete their own potential fours.
2) search for and block the player’s potential fours.
3) if random, prevent the players from getting a four on the top of AI’s latest move.
*Potential fours here  means the situation that one can get a four and win after only one move.
